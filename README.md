7. Formula Student Race Car Problem:  
Fig1: Formula Student 2022 Competition   [1].Formula   Student   (FS) is   an   international   engineering   design   competition, as   shown   in   Fig   1.   Each   year,   since   the   inaugural   competition   in   1979,   teams,   participants,   and students   from   over   20   different   countries   and   over   600   universit代 写MECH0006 Engineering Dynamics 2024Web
代做程序编程语言ies   from   around   the globe   travel   to   Silverstone   to   compete   in   static   and   dynamic   events   that   will   test   their preparation   and   hard   work.   The   challenge   of   this   competition   is   to   develop   a   small   prototype   of   a   Formula-style   single-seat   racecar   that   will   be   evaluated   based   on   many   factors, such   as: general   design, aerodynamics, powertrain, electric   components, etc.In   recent   years, the   FS   competition   has   seen   an   increasing   number   of   Formula   E-like entries. FormulaE   is   an   all-electric   racing   series. Since   making   its   debut   in   the   grounds of   the   Olympic   Park   in   Beijing   in   2014,   Formula   E   has   gone   through   many   changes after attracting a lot of attention for the aim of enhancing its performance      and optimizing   its   design.   Surely,   this   has   been   driven   by   their   environmental   benefits,   increased   consumer   demand, and   the   reduction   in   the   cost   of   the   technology.In   Formula   E   cars,   as   shown   in   Fig   2,   the   power   is   fed   to   the   wheels   after   being   generated   by   an   electric   motor   through   a   gearbox.   Since   electric   motors   are   so   high revving,   the   average   electric   motor   spins   roughly   about   20,000 RPM      which   is   well above   the   road   speed   of   the   wheels, some   reduction   gearing   needs   to   be   provided.   In FormulaE, there area wide range of strategies used to design a transmission gearbox   that   will   efficiently   mandate   the   car’s   power   distribution.
In   this   question, you   are   asked   to   propose   a   conceptual   design   of   a   gearbox   prototype   for a Formula E student racecar and analyse the related dynamics.

c)      Decide   how   many      stages   the      gearbox      needs   to      have   to      achieve   the calculated   transmission   ratio.    (1 Mark)
d)    Indicate the number of   teeth   in   each   gear.    (1 Mark)

iv.             What   happens   to   the   car   topspeed   if   we   take   the   transmission   ratio, calculated 
in   i-b,   and   match   it   with   an   internal   combustion   engine   with   an   engine   speed of   6000   RPM   which   is   the   average   value   for   road   cars? Explain   your   result.       (1 Mark)
